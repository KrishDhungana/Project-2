		<h3>Early Life:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Kathmandu, Nepal</li>
			<li> I was born in Kathmandu, Nepal. Which is a small country in south Asia. I was born there and lived there till the age of 5.</li>
			<li>New York City, New York</li>
			<li>After my parents won a greencard lottery, we moved to New York. This was a big change, as Kathmandu and New York are very different. I attended preschool and kindergarden in New York.</li>
			<li>Chicago, IL</li>
			<li>After living in New York for 3 years, we moved to Chicago. From one big city to another. I then began elementary school in Chicago. </li>

		<h3>Middle Life:</h3>
		<p> During my elementary school life, I was on the basketball and volleyball team. I was also on the math team and guitar club. </p>
		<p>After elementary school I transitioned into high school. I went to Von Steuben, here in Chicago. Here is where I decided to stick with one sport(swimming) and where I began to learn code.
		I found my web development and web design classes to be the most interesting, hence why I am an ITM/Cybersecurity major now. Through my knowledge of HTML, I began to make websites. It started with a current events webpage and it went as far as creating the class webpage for my teacher. </p>
		<p>Below is one of the first websites I ever made:</p>

		<p>Other than school, I held a number jobs. Such as working at Kohls and as a life guard. This was a great base for me, as it was my first taste of the real world. I understood what holding a job meant and the responsibility that came with it. 
		<p> Lastly, travel was a huge part of my life during this time. My family and I would travel at least once a year. </p>
		<p>Here is a list of all the places I have visited (airports included).</p>
		<ul>
			<li>20 US States (Too many to name)</li>
			<li>England</li>
			<li>UAE -- Dubai</li>
			<li>Canada</li>
			<li>Mexico</li>
			<li>Qatar</li>
			<li>Singapore</li>
			<li>France</li>
			<li>Netherlands</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Currently:</h3>
		<p> Now, I am a college student at Illinois Institute of Technology in, Chicago, IL. I am a ITM/Cybersecurity major, in my second year. I have already taken a number of coding and IT management classes.</p>
		<p>While college isn't in session, I work as a Tech Specialist at CDW. The Vernon Hills Location. My prior understanding of work and improved soft skills helped me land this summer job. I worked there this past summer, taking apart hardware and installing software. It was a great experience into the IT industry.</p>
